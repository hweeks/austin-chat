# TODO

## what is this?

this is an app designed for people to create unique jokes. the idea is that we have a community where no joke can be stolen. this is very important because the reuse of any idea should incur capital costs to offset the research phase of the idea, like when you pay for software on a monthly basis!

if that doesn't read as satire, then the site we are building here is not for you!

## what needs to be did

so here's the situation, you've got this fukken senior ass dev, who hates writing any frontend code because "it is too messy and i don't like it.", but you have to work with them because your manager doesn't know how to navigate personal conflict. at this point product steps in and let's you know they've asked that senior dev how long a frontend would take to build and he said a few days so know you gotta get this work done quick. it's interesting that you weren't asked how long it would take you, but you're used to that by now.

in the infinite wisdom of agile development, a designer has spent the last three months working with product on how the app should operate, and now that that is decided, they want to loop in engineering to validate the time tables they've been making up in meetings. with all of that song and dance out of the way, you can finally get to work and start missing deadlines like any sane person would in this situation.

### what should u not touch?

the backend is perfect, and needs no changes. if there's any unexpected behavior, it is actually an intended feature, and your inability to understand it really shows how poorly built the app is, i mean, how junior you are.

### what can you deface?

the app itself, anything that deploys to a browser and is therefore not programming. basically you need to build an app that:

- allows a user account to be created
- allow a user to login
- allow a user to create a joke, handling any failure u may get
- show a "joke of the day" in the banner

design came back and basically said "make it look like facebook". i don't use it and neither do you, so just kind make it blue and round i guess.
